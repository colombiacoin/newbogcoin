BogCoin (BOG) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bogcoin. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bogcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. BogCoin utilizes the Green Protocol, an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm inspired by PIVX/DASH, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. The Green Protocol offers a simple solution to Bogcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.

- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftTX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus based advancement of the current Masternode
  technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with a collateral of 2,500 BOG.
